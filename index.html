                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Ryan. I'm a web developer living in the Dallas, Texas area. I have spent the majority of my career working in IT as a System Administrator. Recently, I decided to take the professional leap to web developent, which has always been my true passion. I have already had a chance to work with some great clients and am looking forward to what the future holds as I further develop my skills!</p>
                    
                   <p> I love spending time with my wife and daughter and am a big proponent of a healthy work life balance. I believe Bigfoot is real and attend a few Bigfoot conventions every year. I am addicted to the queso at Torchys Tacos and believe it is a spiritual experience.</p>
